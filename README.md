ANR project: Predictive scenarios of health in Southeast Asia: linking land use and climate changes to infectious diseases

The project located in Southeast Asia aims at developing scenarios of future health embodied in the One
Health approach at the human-animal-environment interface. By investigating the impacts of the
intensification of the circulation along the economic corridor Thailand-Laos (linking Myanmar to Vietnam)
on the evolution of infectious diseases (IDs) of public health interests it intends to: a) integrate ecology and
environmental sciences with health sciences and policies: b) foster scientific knowledge integration at
various decision levels (regional to local); c) analyze retrospectively and comparatively IDs' dynamics
associated to policies, land use and biodiversity changes; d) combine predictive process-based scenarios and
policy-driven story-telling scenarios of health incorporating disease ecology, biodiversity erosion, future land
use and climate changes.
